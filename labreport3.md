# Part 1
## A failure-inducing input:
```
  @Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input = {1, 2, 3};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3, 2, 1}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input));
  }
```
## An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure:
```
  @Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = { };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```
## The symptom:

## The bug:
Before fix:
```
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```
After fix:
```
 static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return newArray;
  }
```
This fixes the bug because while before the values in the newly created blank array were being reversed and returned, after the fix the values from the original array are being reversed and returned.

This option only searches as many levels deep as specified. It is helpful if you do not want to search too deep into the directory and only want to see files or directories that are a certain amount of levels in.
